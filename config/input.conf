# Gestures configuration for Hyprland v0.51
# New gesture system uses individual gesture definitions
# Format: gesture = fingers, direction, action, [options]

# 3 finger swipe gestures for workspace navigation
gesture = 3, left, workspace, -1          # Swipe left to previous workspace
gesture = 3, right, workspace, +1         # Swipe right to next workspace
gesture = 3, up, fullscreen               # Swipe up for fullscreen
gesture = 3, down, dispatcher, exec, kitty  # Swipe down to open terminal

# 4 finger swipe gestures for window management
gesture = 4, left, move                   # Move window left
gesture = 4, right, move                  # Move window right
gesture = 4, up, close                    # Swipe up to close window
gesture = 4, down, float                  # Swipe down to toggle floating

# Pinch gestures
# Alternative pinch-in options (uncomment one you prefer):
# gesture = 2, pinchin, dispatcher, centerwindow      # Center the active window
# gesture = 2, pinchin, dispatcher, focusurgentorlast # Focus urgent or last window
# gesture = 2, pinchin, workspace, previous           # Go to previous workspace
gesture = 2, pinchin, dispatcher, fullscreen, 1      # Pinch in for maximize (not fullscreen)
gesture = 2, pinchout, dispatcher, fullscreen, 0     # Pinch out for fullscreen
